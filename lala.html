I love you. I know, it might sound a little cheesy, but it's true. I just can't help but feel this overwhelming sense of affection whenever I'm around you.

But, you know what's funny? Saying "I love you" doesn't just have to be about romantic love. Sure, it can be about that intense attraction and desire we feel towards someone we're romantically involved with. But, it can also mean so much more.

Sometimes, "I love you" is a way of saying "I appreciate you." It's a way of acknowledging the value someone brings to our lives, whether it's through their kindness, their humor, or their support.

Other times, "I love you" is about saying "I care about you." It's a way of expressing concern for someone's wellbeing and letting them know that we're there for them, no matter what.

And, then there are those moments when "I love you" is about saying "I'm sorry." It's a way of admitting fault and seeking forgiveness from someone we've hurt.

This love that I'm talking about isn't just the feeling of wanting to kiss you, and although i do, that's not the reason why i say it. I say it because I truly think that I am the only guy in the world who can love  and care for you this much. It serves as a reminder that i give you everytime I can think because no matter how man times i say it, you sometimes forget. Saying I love you isn't as simple as it sounds, you have to carry the weight of its meaning if you do, and I am willing to do just that. I am willing to support you, motivate you, care for you, be there when you need me, and even when you don't, ill always be there. Though I'm not gonna be there for you physically, it's the thought that counts right:>.

I am willing to give you everything I have to see that beautiful smile of yours, as it makes my day when you do. When I hear your laugh, I feel safe and warm with your tone. You make me so happy with the smallest things and the sacrifices that i made make it worth it.
 
So, yeah, "I love you" can mean a lot of different things. But, no matter what it means in a particular moment, the impact it has on our relationships can be truly powerful. And when I say it to you, as often as i do, what you just read is what's on my mind. I hope you remember this my love. Happy anniversary:>");
